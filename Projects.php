A program run by QMUL which involved the use of python to analyse and manipulate data from data sets using python libraries NumPy and matplotlib to accurately 
achieve a phase fold of a change in star luminosity from the Kepler mission, to later calculate the radius of the planet orbiting around it. This programme used 
the real data from the Kepler mission, resulting in the use of genuine data, being a great opportunity to expand on previous python knowledge and experience these 2 libraries.
