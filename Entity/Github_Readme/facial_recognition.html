<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>This repo contains a basic facial recognition login system where facial biometrics are used in place of traditional passwords. The system strengthens overtime with each<br>
successfull login adding to the bank of facial images used to discern if the user is who they identify to be.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="signup">Signup</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Users will be required to input some basic details such as name, username and email into a form. Once done, their image will be taken and displayed on screen. The<br>
user will then be prompted to either upload or retake the photo, repeating the photography process until the user is satisfied and willing to upload their image. The<br>
image taken is required to have 1 face in it, or the option to upload will not be available, 0 or multiple faces wonâ€™t be accepted. Along with the image, the rest of<br>
the data is then sent to the database to be stored.</p>
