<h3>Past Project Highlights</h3>
<div class="info"> 
<h4>UNIQ Digital - Oxford</h4>
<h5>Online Course - RStudio</h5>
<h6>An online programme run by Oxford university connecting current students to prospective students. Its focus was on giving us resources to be better prepared for 
    the university application process through tasks such as research projects and essay writing.An optional R-Studio programming course was provided, 
    which gave an in-depth explanation and understanding of the language with a programming test at the end to gauge what we learnt at the end of the course, 
    where I achieved 95/100.

<h4>QMUL Python Exoplanet Hunting Programme</h4>
<h5>Online Course - RStudio</h5>
<h6>A program run by QMUL which involved the use of python to analyse and manipulate data from data sets using python libraries NumPy and matplotlib to accurately 
    achieve a phase fold of a change in star luminosity from the Kepler mission, to later calculate the radius of the planet orbiting around it. This programme used 
    the real data from the Kepler mission, resulting in the use of genuine data, being a great opportunity to expand on previous python knowledge and experience these 2 libraries.</h6>
