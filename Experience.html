            Learning, Cyber Security, 3D Game Development (UE4), Robotics and securing my already existing Python knowledge by
            introducing me to new libraries such as Tkinter for GUIs and google vision as well as developing previous knowledge
            such as in NumPy, PIL and TensorFlow.
            Alongside this, the role required the necessary social skills to engage and manage students to ensure they both
            enjoy themselves and learn effectively, joined with calm and logical thinking to manage any issues that occur, both with
            the students and parents.

            Competition for people from 14-28 supported by Waltham Forest council. Qualifiers were tasked to design a
            product to help improve safety in the borough from Waltham Forest. Within my group of 4, I was product and
            project manager, where our pitch and design of an app idea placed us 2nd. It helped not only with team building
            and leadership but also became a great opportunity to learn how to network with people from a business
            background.
