        Competition for people from 14-28 supported by Waltham Forest council. Qualifiers were tasked to design a 
        product to help improve safety in the borough from Waltham Forest. Within my group of 4, I was product and 
        project manager, where our pitch and design of an app idea placed us 2nd. It helped not only with team building 
        and leadership but also became a great opportunity to learn how to network with people from a business background.
