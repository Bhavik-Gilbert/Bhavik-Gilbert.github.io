Competition for people from 14-28 supported by Waltham Forest council. Qualifiers were tasked to design a 
product to help improve safety in the borough from Waltham Forest. Within my group of 4, I was product and 
project manager, where our pitch and design of an app idea placed us 2nd. It helped not only with team building
